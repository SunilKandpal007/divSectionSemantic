# divSectionSemantic
HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements that provide better structure and meaning to web documents. These elements help search engines and assistive technologies understand the content more effectively and improve overall code readability. Ex.- &lt;header>, &lt;nav>, &lt;main>, &lt;article>, &lt;section>, &lt;aside>, &lt;footer>.
